    <h1>Leap Year</h1>
    <p>A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE">Video about that.</a></p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4;</p>
    <p>except if that is also evenly divisible by 100;</p>
    <p>unless that year is also evenly divisible by 400.</p>
